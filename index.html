        <p>
            The goal of analyzing an algorithm is to provide a general baseline for its efficiency, as measured by the time and space needed to finish its execution. To do this, we first need to specify an appropriate model of computation. We want our hypothetical model to be general enough so that our analysis remains true regardless of the device it is being executed on, and easy enough to reason with. The Random-Access Machine (RAM) model satisfies these requirements.

        <p>
            Initially, I thought this post would be a simple introduction to algorithms and their analysis. Naturally, the first thing I thought to do was to introduce the definition of an algorithm. This is where I ran into some trouble. Typically in textbooks and online resources, an algorithm is informally introduced as a step-by-step process that solves a problem in a finite amount of time. We usually require algorithms to be unambiguous (each instruction to be executed has only one interpretation), and finite (they always come to an end).

        <p>
            I&rsquo;m currently about to finish my undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science. And while my formal education is coming to an end, I find that I haven&rsquo;t even scratched the surface of what is to be learned. What&rsquo;s even worse is that I&rsquo;ve found that the knowledge I have acquired disappears without constant use, and while I can usually relearn things quickly, I&rsquo;d prefer if I didn&rsquo;t have to go through the process.
